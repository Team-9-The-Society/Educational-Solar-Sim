<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Orbit Learn is an educational n-body simulation mobile app. We have made an easy and intuitive lab activity to introduce students to the physics of our solar system. The goal is to provide an affordable 3D alternative to the typical sheet and balls.

Here are some reasons that make Orbit Learn better than a sheet and bowling ball!

- It is free! All that is required is a mobile phone!
- It allows for the students to experment on their own.
- It has 3D capibilities!
- It's video game esc, engages students!
- It removes the physical limitations of Earth's gravity and friction.

This is an app made soley for education purposes. Do not use this for any purpose that needs a high degree of presision (like launching rockets)!
